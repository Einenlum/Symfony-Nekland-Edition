Symfony Nekland Edition
=======================

Notice that this project is a fork from the Symfony Standard Edition.

Why ?
-----

* Because we all are bored to re-configure each project from the symfony standard edition
* Because some things are useless in the standard edition
* Because some things are missing in the standard edition


Philosophy
----------

### About assets

* Assets should be managed by Bower -> bower support
* Bower should be automaticaly installed, as any usefull node script -> npm support

### Documentation files

We do not disturb your home dev directory with some documentation. You can find it on the
`app/Resources/doc` folder ;-) .

Notice that it's a good place to documente your project :) .


Here we go
----------

First thing you have to do is to clear this README to add your text ;-) .

Then checkout the `app/Resources/doc/nekland` to learn more about this distribution.
